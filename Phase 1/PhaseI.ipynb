    "Factors Affecting Sales and Ratings for Car Models Sold in the United States<br> <br>\n",
    "<b>Q2) Why did I choose this specific topic and what am I looking to learn from the analysis? </b> <br>\n",
    "By analyzing whether fuel economy has been affecting car sales in recent years, I can provide manufacturers with the necessary insight to create new models that cater towards their customers' needs. I hope to see a trend that relates different fuel economies from different manufacturers to their success in terms of sales and consumer ratings. This will allow me to draw conclusions regarding ways that a manufacturer could increase sales and consumer ratings. <br> <br>\n",
    "<b>Q3) Explain some of the concrete insights I expect to gather from your data and/or hypothesis I expect to answer. </b> <br>\n",
    "I expect to see that car models with higher fuel economies will have higher sales and consumer ratings. When comparing across years, I expect to see that quarter 3 car sales for cars in 2020 will be lower due to the pandemic this year. <br><br>"

However, it would be beneficial to provide car companies with insight as to whether fuel economy has an impact on their car sales and consumer ratings. For this reason, I chose a dataset that showed fuel economies for different cars and a dataset that showed consumer ratings for different cars. <br><br>"

    "## About My Analysis\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Q7) Provide a list of steps of how you plan on performing your analysis and the way you will gather/present your findings. (Non-technical, high-level overview) </b><br>\n",
    "1) Collect consumer car rating data from JDPower.com for each car (2019 and 2020 model) and convert to csv. <br>\n",
    "2) From the government dataset, group all the trims of the same model together and calculate their average combined conventional fuel economy. <br>\n",
    "3) From the government dataset, extract car make, model, year, and average combined conventional fuel economy and write this data to a new csv file. <br>\n",
    "4) From the car sales website, webscrape the data from HTML to extract the individual car sales for each model in the third quarter of 2019 and 2020. <br>\n",
    "5) From JD Power, scrape and collect the ratings for each car model in both 2019 and 2020. <br>\n",
    "6) Run statistical tests to identify whether there is a significant correlation between our datasets. <br>\n",
    "7) From the statistical tests, we look at the relationships between fuel economy, car sales across 2019 and 2020, and car ratings across 2019 and 2020, and generate 5 insights from the analysis we performed. <br>\n",
    "8) We will make 4 data visualizations. We will visualize the fuel economy mapped against the car sales. Aditionally, we will visualize the car sales data to the car ratings. We will visualize the car ratings data to the fuel economy. Then, we will make a 3D model mapping all 3 data sets against each other. <br>\n",
    "9) We will create a powerpoint presentation that displays our data, how we analyzed our data, our different insights and visualizations, and the conclusions we drew from each of these. We will then give a brief explanation as to how our conclusions can be applied to the industry. <br>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Q8) Explain how you intend on collecting, cleaning, and analyzing the data you gather as well as the manner in which you plan on presenting your insights. (More detailed, include modules, techniques, etc.). </b><br>\n",
    "1) For the collecting and cleaning of the combined fuel economy data on each car model from 2017-2020, we downloaded the dataset from the data.gov website. <br>\n",
    "2) We read the csv file in as a pandas dataFrame in Jupyter Notebook. <br>\n",
    "3) From this data, we spliced the dataframe to only include data from 2019 and 2020 using .loc. <br>\n",
    "4) Then, we narrowed the dataframe down to only the columns containing the model year, brand, model, and combined fuel economy on conventional fuel. <br>\n",
    "5) Then, we exported this cleaned dataframe to a csv named \"carFE.csv\". <br>\n",
    "6) For the web collection and cleaning of the data containing the car sales for each model in the United States for the third quarter of 2019 and 2020, we used requests to retrieve the url. <br>\n",
    "7) We then used BeautifulSoup to parse and scrape the sales data from the website. <br>\n",
    "8) Using BeautifulSoup's find_all method, we found the table tag that contained the sales data. <br>\n",
    "9) We then got the text from each of the tags that contaned the name of the model, the 2019 sales data, and the 2020 sales data and put each of these into lists. <br>\n",
    "10) Lastly, we will use .loc to create a dataframe from our lists. <br>\n",
    "11) We will then write this dataframe to a csv file. <br>\n",
    "12) For the web collection and cleaning of the data containing the ratings for each car model, we used requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and json.<br>\n",
    "13) We will then iterate through the car models list we created and will access the associated JDpower website for the specific model, make, and year. <br>\n",
    "14) From this site, we will parse and scrape the JDpower rating using BeautifulSoup and json only if there is one given (otherwise we will set the rating to null).<br>\n",
    "15) We will repeat this for all car models for 2019 and again for 2020. <br>\n",
    "16) We will create a dataframe that maps each car model to its associated rating for 2019 and 2020 using .loc. <br>\n",
    "17) We will then write this dataframe to a csv. <br>\n",
    "18) Then, using the three csv files that we have written to, we will read them back into Jupyter Notebook as dataframes and compare each data set to each other. <br>\n",
    "19) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the fuel economy and car sales for 2019. <br>\n",
    "20) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the fuel economy and car sales for 2020. <br>\n",
    "21) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the fuel economy and car ratings for 2019. <br>\n",
    "22) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the fuel economy and car ratings for 2020. <br>\n",
    "23) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the car sales for 2019 and ratings for 2019. <br>\n",
    "24) We will conduct a statistical t-test and p-value test between the car sales for 2020 and ratings for 2020. <br>\n",
    "25) Each of these tests will be run through its own function. We will, then, identify which tests yield interesting and significant results. We will export our conclusions and results to 2 reports. <br>\n",
